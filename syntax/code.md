# Code blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used to write about programming or highlight a source code. More than just paragraphs, the lines of code in a code block are literally interpreted.

Here is an example:

```
This is a code block 
```

To create a code block in Markdown, indent each line of the block with at least 4 spaces or a tab.

For example:

```
This is a normal paragraph:
    This is a code block. 
```

You can also create a separate code block with:

Inline code blocks can be written using: `

For example:

### The syntax of highlighting

Example:

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
